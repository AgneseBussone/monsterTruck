# monsterTruck (Work in progress)

This application runs on a raspberry pi mounted on a 30$ RC monster truck which has been unmounted and tweaked. With this application, the system is capable to comunicate to any device connected to its wifi network and can accept commands from them to go forward, backward, turn right, turn left, turn on the high beams and brake (during the brake red leds will be on).
